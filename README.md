Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Welcome!

In this project, I have developed an application that allows a user to view a homepage that displays fan-favorite movies throughout the page. The user is able to click on any specific movie poster and get a detailed description of the movie. From there, the user can click the button below the description which will re-route the user back to the home page.

After browsing through the movies, the user is able to click on the "Add a Movie" button and add a new movie to the home page! The user is able to enter in the title of the movie, an image URL for the movie, select the genre of the movie, along with entering a description of what the movie is about. Once the user is done, they are able to click "Save", and head back to the home page, which should display the user's newly added movie!
